#### Note

- To make it easier for me, I'll use `create-react-app` to setup the project and use _ant design_ as a UI lib
- I need to store the youtube link somewhere, so I use Firebase as a storage and also use it to deploy the app
- I've not applyed test to the project before, so research and integrate test take a little bit time
- This demo was finished in 2 days (23/3 - 24/3)
- I really enjoyed this test btw

#### Tech stack

- React, React router dom
- Ant Design
- Firebase: Database, Hosting

#### Features

Basically, this demo includes all the required feature from the test. Beside, I also support some small features
to improve UX

- Validate youtube link, support format youtube link to embed link
