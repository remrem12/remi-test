# Remi test

#### Note

- To make it easier for me, I'll use `create-react-app` to setup the project and use ant design as a UI lib
- I need to store the youtube link somewhere, so I use Firebase as a storage and also use it to deploy the app
- I've not apply test to the project before, so research and integrate test take a little bit time
